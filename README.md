# holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone

HBnB, is a clone of the AirBnB website. It gives the ability to create different locations, users, and reviews for the locations. Currently it only runs as a console. It can desplay all of the instances of all created objects, or display only the instances of a specific type of object (user, review, city, place, state, amenity). The user can also delete any of these created objects.

This repository contains several packages that include the various models that will be employed in the application as objects, a file storage schema class, and various tests written using the unittest module of Python.
